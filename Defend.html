                How to defend yourself.
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways to defend yourself online from cyber attacks. They can range from using a better password or not opening suspicious emails online to enabling two-step 
                verification on top of a strong password to further protect your accounts.
                Below is a list of tips to improve your own personal safety online:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Passwords</b> - This is a requirement on many sites currently and range from using capital and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols to improve your password's effectiveness.</li>
                    <li><b>Updates</b> - This is simply keeping all of your software like your operating system, browser and anti-virus up to date, which is often offered for free by most companies.</li>
                    <li><b>Verify</b> - This is as simple as verifying with your boss or companies that they asked for your private information before inputting it.</li>
                    <li><b>E-mails</b> - Turn off the option to automatically download attachments from open emails. This can prevent things like Malware which come from outside sources.</li>
                    <li><b>URLs</b> - This is simply making sure the URL of the website you are on matches the URL of the website you were looking for. Many hackers use similarly spelled websites
                    or websites with different domains to trick users into inputting personal information.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <div id="afterlist">
                    Of course, to further protect yourself online it is recommended to download or enable an adblocker. This will reduce the risk of the user mis-clicking on a page and being
                    forced to download possibly malicious software like ransomware. Another easy way to protect yourself is to follow a few more tricks. These are to never give out 
                    personal information online or through messages unless you completely trust the person you are telling it to. Social engineering is used by some people to deceive
                    others into giving out personal information related to private accounts by acting as retailers or collection agencies.
