                of tips to improve your own personal safety online<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Passwords</b> - This is a requirement on many sites currently and range from using capital and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols to improve your password's effectiveness.</li>
                    <li><b>Updates</b> - This is simply keeping all of your software like your operating system, browser and anti-virus up to date, which is often offered for free by most companies.</li>
                    <li><b>Verify</b> - This is as simple as verifying with your boss or companies that they asked for your private information before inputting it.</li>
                    <li><b>E-mails</b> - Turn off the option to automatically download attachments from open emails. This can prevent things like Malware which come from outside sources.</li>
                    <li><b>URLs</b> - This is simply making sure the URL of the website you are on matches the URL of the website you were looking for. Many hackers use similarly spelled websites
                    or websites with different domains to trick users into inputting personal information.</li>
