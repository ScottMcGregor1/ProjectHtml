                What is a Threat?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A cyber security threat refers to any malicious attack used to unlawfully access data, disrupt operations or damage information.
                They can come from a range of sources, whether it be an ex-employee, a corporate spy, terrorist group or just a lone hacker.<br>
                Attackers can use these attacks to gain access to a wide range of personal data like credit card information or healthcare data.
                An recent example of a large scale cyber attack is the 2017 Equifax breach, which ended up compromising the data of 143 million consumers.<br>
                This data included birth dates, Social Security numbers and addresses. The hackers can then use this data to commit identity fraud.

            <h3>
                Types of Threats.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Here is a range of threats that any professional or continual user of computers should know:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Malware</b> - This means malicious software and some examples of such are spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. Once activated, Cisco reports
                    that it can block access to parts of the divice - ransomware -, install additional malware and covertly steal data - spyware.</li>
                    <li><b>DoS</b> - This means a Denial of service attack and is done through attacks that flood a computer or network so it is unable to fulfill requests.</li>
                    <li><b>Man in the middle</b> - This type of attack is done through a hacker inserting themselves between a 2 party transaction. After doing this, they can 
                    filter and steal the data.</li>
                    <li><b>Phishing</b> - these attacks use fake communication such as spam emails or fake phone messages to trick the reader into opening it and installing Malware or
                    inputting personal information.</li>
                    <li><b>Password Attacks</b> - these attacks can be done through either brute force or social engineering to give the hacker access to user's password
                        and through that, their information.</li>
                </ul>
