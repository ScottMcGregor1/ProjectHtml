            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                Cyber security is the practice of either an individual or group to protect computers, servers, mobile devices and data from malicious attacks. It applies in a wide range of contexts,
                from business computing to mobile networks to video games.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Cyber Security</h3>
            <p>

                    <li><b>Network Security</b> - This is the practice of protecting the user's or company's network from intruders, whether this is physical or online.<br></li><br>

            <h3>The Importance of Cyber Security</h3>
            <p>
                Cyber security has become increasingly important in previous years, with billions of people worldwide using computers this is not a large suprise. Many people's lives
                depend completely on computers, whether this is their jobs, their banking, their healthcare and even the government is reliant on them.<br> Cyber Security and cyber -
                attacks are now a large concern for anyone, with large enough attacks liable to devastate economies. Because of this, any large company and all governments have to
                prepare the highest quality security they can to prevent them. This of course leads to the large costs of high level cyber security, with many apps that assist in it
                costing hundreds to thousands of pounds.
